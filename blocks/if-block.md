**## \**What is an IF block?\****



The IF block acts as a check to see if a value has met certain conditions or not. If it meets a condition, the skill will execute down the corresponding path.

## IF block example



The IF block can be used to make comparisons of things like numbers or words. You can use it to see how many sessions a user has. If it is a users first time in an app, their session can be checked if it is equal to 1 and they are sent down one path. If they have more than 1 session, they can be sent down another path.

## Maximum number of options

Within the IF block you can create conditions. These conditions are numbered and will be evaluated in numerical order. You can create up to 20 different conditions within a single IF block.





Each IF statement you add has a number beside it which corresponds to the number on the IF block. The '1' Statement corresponds with the '1' port on the IF block.

If the condition we put in the #1 Statement is evaluated as true then the IF block will take the user down that path. If statement #1 is not true, then statement #2 will be evaluated next and so on. If there is no match after running through al the conditions then the user will be taken down the ELSE path.



## Adding paths

To add paths, hit the add If statement button and create a new condition to compare against.
