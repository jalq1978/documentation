- How to end skills within command blocks using the Exit block

## **What the Exit Block Does**

The name is self-explanatory, but when executed, the Exit block will exit the skill. The skill will end immediately without any text playing. Its use is very convenient to **leave the skill from a flow** (by default, the flow will return to the last place from which it was used).

## **Is the Exit Block the only way to end the skill? ðŸ¤”**

No! You can also end your skills by reaching the final connected block in the HOME flow. 

## **How to Use the Exit Block**

Using the Exit block is incredibly easy. All you have to do is link the Exit block when you would like the skill to end. 

For example, in our Choice below, if the user says the first choice option, a Speak block will play telling the user they made a mistake, followed by an Exit block.
