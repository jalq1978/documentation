- What the Exit block is and how it works
- How to end skills within command blocks using the Exit block

## **What the Exit Block Does**

The name is self-explanatory, but when executed, the Exit block will exit the skill. The skill will end immediately without any text playing. Its use is very convenient to **leave the skill from a flow** (by default, the flow will return to the last place from which it was used).

## When the exit block is not needed

The exit block is not needed to exit your skill everytime. The exit block will only ever be needed when you want to force an exit from within a flow. Exit blocks are not needed on the HOME flow to exit your skill.



## Using the exit block

To use the exit block, add it to the end of a flow and connect it to the last block in the flow where you want to exit the skill
