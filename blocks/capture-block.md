## What the Capture Block Does

The Capture block allows you to capture the user's response into a variable. Once this response is stored in the variable, you can use this value throughout the rest of the skill. 

- i.e. You can ask the user what their name is using a Speak block, then follow that up with a capture block to capture the user's name into a name variable. You could then use the user's name throughout the rest of the project. this is a gchange to demonstrate github.

## How to use the capture block 



The capture block takes in users input and saves it to a variable. The type of input must be defined by selecting the Slot type. 

You must also store what the user says into a variable. Variables can be selected from the "Select Variable" drop down.

## No Response

If the user does not respond, a response can be given to prompt them to be asked again. Hit the three dot menu and select "No Reply Response"

There are two types of input for this response:

1. Text to speech
