## Getting started

### Voiceflow overview

Voiceflow is a platform for designers, developers and teams to design, prototype, and build Alexa Skills and Google Actions without coding. It's used for two primary usecases:

1. Design and prototype: used for the design, prototyping, and user testing of Alexa Skills & Google Actions
2. Build and publish: used for the design, prototype, and eventual publishing directly to the Alexa/Google app stores
