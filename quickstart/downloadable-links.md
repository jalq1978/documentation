**Step 2**Once a project is downloaded to your workspace you can then access the project from your dashboard. This project is now a completely separate version from the original.

Once the Project Settings window opens head to the bottom and open up the Downloadable Link drop down. Select the Copy Link button and the link it now ready to share! Paste the link anywhere you would like to share.
