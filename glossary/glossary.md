**Implicit Confirmation**

A prompt that subtly repeats back what Alexa heard to give the customer assurance that they were correctly understood. In the following example, repeating back the word horoscope is a landmarking technique used to establish trust with the customer but still supports natural dialog. For example, "Alexa, ask Astrology Daily for my horoscope". Alexa would then ask to clarify the request with, "Horoscope for what sign?"

<br><br>

**Intent(s)**

Tasks your assistant can do for you. Simply put, an intent is the user's intention in a given sentence or command.

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

Technology used to aid computers in understanding the human's natural language. NLP lets people and machines talk to each other “naturally”.

**Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**

NLU Can be thought of as a subfield of NLP. NLU more specifically deals with machine reading, or reading comprehension. NLU goes beyond the sentence structure and aims to understand the intended meaning of language. While humans are able to effortlessly handle mispronunciations, swapped words, contractions, colloquialisms, and other quirks, machines are less adept at handling unpredictable inputs. Enter NLU.

<br><br>

**Required Slot**

A slot that contains values that are necessary for Alexa to complete the user's request. For example, Alexa, ask Astrology Daily for the horoscope for Taurus. Without the name of the specific zodiac sign, Astrology Daily cannot provide a horoscope. If the user does not provide a value for a required slot, you must ask the user for that slot value.
[(source)](https://www.voiceflow.com/glossary/required-slot ':alt="Vocieflow"')
<br><br>

**Slots**

In many scenarios, intents alone are not enough to fulfill a request. This is where "slots" come into play. Slots act like traditional form fields in the sense that they can be optional or required depending on what's needed to complete the request. They are variables that relate back to the intent. For example, in the sentence "order me a large mocha coffee", the words "large" and "mocha" would be classified as slots or necessary options that are needed to fulfill the ask from the users.

**System Persona**

The system persona is the conversational partner created to be the front end of the technology that the user will interact with directly.
