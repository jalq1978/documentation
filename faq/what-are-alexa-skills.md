## What are Alexa skills and Google actions?

A quick crash course on Alexa skills (aka Amazon's voice apps).

**Introduction** Alexa skills are voice apps that run on Amazon's voice assistant, Alexa. Voice assistants are things like Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Samsung's Bixby, and Google Assistant. Just like smart phones, these smart voice assistants can host apps - and these apps are powered by your voice.

**What kinds of Alexa skills & Google actions can people make?** Pretty much anything you can think of. Here are some of the big use cases:

- **Interactive Stories:** With Voiceflow, you can make awesome 'Choose Your Own Adventure' stories that allow you to tell stories players can play with their voice, controlling their character and making decisions.
- **Interactive Games:** With Voiceflow, you can make awesome interactive voice controlled games. Games can be role-playing-games, trivia games, or anything else you can imagine that has users using their voice.
- **Business Skills:** Want to order a pizza with your voice? What about call a cab? How about order tickets online? These are all business use cases you can build with Voiceflow.
